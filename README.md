# "Git in Gear" Workshop: Your First Steps into Efficient Coding with Visual Studio Code & Azure DevOps

Welcome to the "Git in Gear" workshop, where we dive into the exciting world of Git and its seamless integration with Visual Studio Code and Azure DevOps. Our focus here is to provide hands-on experience in managing code changes, promoting collaboration, and enhancing integration and security of your codebase.

This workshop is divided into several labs:

## üíª Lab 01 - VS Code & Git Setup

In this lab, you'll familiarize yourself with the VS Code interface and perform initial Git setup. This includes creating your first local repository and linking it to your Azure devops project account.

## üîÄ Lab 02 - Basic Git Operations

Here, you'll learn fundamental Git operations such as staging, committing, and pushing changes, all within the VS Code environment.

## üîÑ Lab 04 - Branching and Merging

In this lab, you'll learn how to create branches, switch between them, and merge changes from one branch into another. This will enable you to work on multiple features independently and integrate them when ready.

## üìö Lab 05 - Learning Git Log and Git Diff

This lab focuses on understanding your repository's history. You'll explore the usage of git log to view commit history and git diff to compare changes between commits or branches.

## üéØ Lab 06 - Git Reset, Revert and Checkout

Here, you'll get hands-on experience with some powerful Git commands. Learn how to navigate your project's history and modify it using git reset, git revert, and git checkout.

## ü§ù Lab 07 - Collaborative Development Using Git

In this final lab, you'll learn about collaborative development using Git. You'll understand how to fetch and pull changes from remote repositories, handle merge conflicts, and use git stash to save changes that aren't ready to be committed.
